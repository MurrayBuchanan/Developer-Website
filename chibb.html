                <h2>The process</h2>
                <p>Working on this mobile game alongside my studies has been a great learning experience. Chibb has allowed me to apply my current knowledge of Software Engineering to a real-world project. I've been able to improve my programming and design skills, and I've also learned a lot about project management. Beyond that, this project has really sparked my creativity and improved my problem-solving abilities, which I know will be useful in any career. Overall, it's not just about the game itself, but about building a strong foundation for my future in game development.</p>
